# Front End

## I am using React for the front end development. The styling is managed with Tailwind CSS, and I have integrated the Ant Design component library to enhance the UI/UX . For authentication, I am utilizing Firebase to manage user logins securely and efficiently..

# Back End

## The back-end is built with Node.js and Express.js to handle server-side operations. The database is managed using MongoDB to store and retrieve data efficiently.
